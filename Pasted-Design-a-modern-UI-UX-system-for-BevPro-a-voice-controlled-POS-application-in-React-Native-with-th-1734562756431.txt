Design a modern UI/UX system for BevPro, a voice-controlled POS application in React Native, with the following specifications:
Visual Design Language:

Create a design system inspired by Apple's Human Interface Guidelines while maintaining platform fluidity for both iOS and Android
Implement a frosted glass morphism aesthetic with subtle transparency and blur effects (using rgba values) to create depth
Use smooth, organic animations with gentle ease curves for all transitions (0.3s duration)
Incorporate micro-interactions that provide subtle feedback for voice commands
Design with a minimum touch target size of 44x44pt for optimal accessibility

Color Palette:

Primary: Soft mint (#4CD7B0) for main actions and success states
Secondary: Calm lavender (#9381FF) for secondary elements
Background: Pearl white gradient (#F8F9FC to #F0F2F8)
Dark elements: Deep navy (#1A1B4B) for text and icons
Accent: Coral pink (#FF7C7C) for important alerts or highlights
All colors should have 60-30-10 distribution ratio

Typography:

Primary font: SF Pro Display for iOS, Roboto for Android
Use dynamic type scaling with these modular sizes:

Headlines: -apple-system, 32pt, weight: 700
Subheads: -apple-system, 24pt, weight: 600
Body: -apple-system, 16pt, weight: 400
Caption: -apple-system, 14pt, weight: 400



Layout & Components:

Implement auto-layout with flexible spacing using 8pt grid system
Design for these screen breakpoints:

iPhone SE: 375pt
iPhone 14 Pro Max: 428pt
iPad Mini: 744pt
iPad Pro: 1024pt


Use floating action buttons for primary voice controls
Implement bottom sheets for secondary menus
Create cards with subtle shadows (elevation: 2, opacity: 0.1)

Voice Interface Elements:

Design a pulsing voice indicator using concentric circles with opacity animations
Include subtle sound wave visualizations during voice input
Create clear visual feedback states for:

Listening mode
Processing command
Command confirmed
Error state



Navigation:

Tab bar with home, orders, menu, and settings
Gesture-based navigation with swipe actions
Clear visual hierarchy with breadcrumbs for deep navigation

Accessibility:

Support dynamic type scaling
Maintain contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
Include haptic feedback for important actions
Design clear focus states for keyboard navigation
